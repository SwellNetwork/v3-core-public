# 20231106 Frontend

Severity: Medium

Discovered By: immunefi (@drake23)

## Issue

- An open redirect was identified which could redirect a user to a third party website when provided with a link to the dapp
- At the time the issue was identified, Swell Network was relying on Firebase for website hosting
- Swell Network was able to confirm via Firebase that the open redirect was caused by an issue within Firebase

## Impact

- No users reported they were impacted by this issue
- No examples of the open redirect being used was reported
- Swell Network immediately blocked access to the offending URL once made aware of the issue
- Swell Network has since migrated away from Firebase hosting
